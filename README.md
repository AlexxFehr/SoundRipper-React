# SoundRipper-React
React retype of the SoundRipper repo. A simple webapp which is able to download high quality rips of audio from YouTube and other streaming services. The webapp downloads the audio-track in the higher quality OPUS-coded format and then converts it to the desired fileformat, thus keeping the higher resolution sound.
